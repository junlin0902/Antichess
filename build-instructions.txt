if we want to run the program in LINUX,

-eve: python3 antichess.py (with no arguments)
-pve: python3 antichess.py white (given argument)
      python3 antichess.py black

if we give more than 2 arguments, program will exit
if we give argument other than "white", player will automatically be seen as player black
